## Sendcode App
This project, which I built for __educational purposes__, is an online temporary clipboard for codes. I built this to learn how to _dockerize a Spring Boot App_ and _deploy with Jenkins_. So, app can have some bugs but any contribution will be appreciated.

You can find the demo on http://sendcode.me. Don't forget, I hosted this app on a three-months-free server of Hetzner. After free credits, application won't be on this address.

 I used:
- Spring Boot
- Postgres
- Prism.js
- Bootstrap
